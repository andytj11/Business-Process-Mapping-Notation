Documentation to understand the application


# Files

1. DatabaseIntegration.ts
Purpose: Acts as a specialized BPMN.js module that handles all database-related concerns.

Responsibilities:

Listens for BPMN diagram events (creation, updates, deletion)
Maps BPMN elements to database entities
Manages the bidirectional relationship between BPMN IDs and database IDs
Provides utility methods for finding and highlighting elements
Encapsulates database operation logic separate from rendering concerns
Key benefits:

Can be reused across different BPMN viewers or editors
All database logic is centralized in one place
Changes to database schema only require updates to this file
Can be independently tested without UI dependencies

2. BpmnModeler.tsx
Purpose: React component wrapper around the BPMN.js modeler that manages the UI aspects.

Responsibilities:

Renders and manages the BPMN modeler canvas
Initializes the modeler with appropriate modules
Configures the DatabaseIntegration module with context and callbacks
Manages component lifecycle (mount, unmount)
Exposes an API via refs for parent components
Handles UI-specific state (selected elements, saving indicator)
Key benefits:

Focused on presentation and interaction
Doesn't need to understand database details
Can be replaced or upgraded without affecting database integration logic
Clear separation between UI events and data persistence

3. page.tsx (Modeler Page)
Purpose: Orchestrates the application logic and connects components.

Responsibilities:

Manages application state (processes, nodes, current selection)
Provides callbacks for database operations to the modeler
Handles user interactions at the page level
Manages process workflow (creating, loading diagrams)
Displays feedback to users (success messages, errors)
Key benefits:

Acts as a controller between UI components and services
Can change UI components without affecting business logic
Maintains high-level state for the application
Why This Separation Is Beneficial
Maintainability: When the database schema changes, you only need to update DatabaseIntegration.ts.

Testability: You can test each component in isolation:

Test DatabaseIntegration module with mocked BPMN.js events
Test BpmnModeler with mocked database callbacks
Test page.tsx with mocked components
Reusability: The DatabaseIntegration module could be used with different BPMN viewers (like a read-only viewer vs. an editor).

Scalability: As your application grows, having these concerns separated makes it easier to:

Add new features (e.g., collaborative editing)
Add more detailed database operations
Support different diagram types beyond BPMN
Team Collaboration: Different team members can work on different aspects:

Backend developers can focus on the DatabaseIntegration
Frontend developers can focus on the UI components
UX designers can change the page layout without affecting functionality
Your implementation follows a clean architecture pattern where each component has a single responsibility, making your code more robust and easier to maintain in the long run.
