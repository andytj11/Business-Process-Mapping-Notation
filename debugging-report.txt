		- Issue found due to:
		nodes: {
          //   include: {
          //       // parameters: true // Ensure this relation exists in the schema before including it
          //   }
          // },
		  - Explanation:
		  You're not requesting a parameters relation inside the nodes, 
		  so Prisma just fetches the nodes without trying to include a non-existent relation, and everything works fine.
